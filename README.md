# Test wordpress environment on Github
## About
This is a testing environment for workingwith WordPress and Github.
I have created 2 new branches :
1.- Plugins
2.- child-theme
<br/>Where I will work on and upload changes to the stagging tree.
I have linked this repo to a project where I will try and track changes to files and log issues and milestones.<br/>
This project/ repo is a testing site for me to learn and practice Git, Github with my favourite platform WOrdPress.
